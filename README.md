### Project Description
This project is a humorous twist on the classic to-do list application. Instead of allowing users to add their own productive tasks, the app mischievously sabotages their efforts by replacing their input with randomly selected, unproductive “failure” tasks such as “Scroll Instagram” or “Daydream about success.”

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

In today’s fast-paced world, people are far too productive. They wake up early, complete their tasks, chase goals, and, worst of all, get things done. This productivity epidemic leaves no time for the finer things in life—like staring at the ceiling for hours or scrolling Instagram endlessly. Society urgently needs a way to help people procrastinate effectively.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Introducing Interactive To-Do (But Not Really)—the world’s first anti-productivity app.
Whenever you try to add something useful to your to-do list, it replaces it with a carefully curated, laziness-approved “failure” task such as “Do nothing useful” or “Procrastinate more.” This ensures you never accidentally become too productive, while still giving you the satisfaction of checking items off a list.
